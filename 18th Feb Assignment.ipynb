    "\n",
    "Versioning: Changes in API versions can cause compatibility issues with existing applications, requiring additional development\n",
    "    effort to keep systems up-to-date.\n",

    "Cost: Developing and maintaining APIs can be expensive, especially for smaller businesses or startups, which may not have the\n",
